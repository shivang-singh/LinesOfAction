<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>An ordinary checkerboard (8x8 squares), 12 black and 12 white pieces are needed;
  in the standard version of the game, as you can see in the image below, the black
  checkers are placed in two rows along the top and bottom of the board, while the
  white pieces are placed in two rows at the left and right of the board.
  The aim of the game is to move own pieces until they are all in one connected group;
  two pieces are considered to be connected when they are placed in horizantal,
  vertical or diagonal adjacent squares.
  Black moves first. Each player moves one of his pieces in every turn.
  Pieces are moved in a straight line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), exactly as
  many squares as there are pieces of either colour anywhere along the line of movement.
  Moved piece cannot land on a square occupied by one piece of the same colour. However,
  opponent pieces can be captured by landing on them.
  Moved piece may jump over pieces of the same colour, but not over opponent pieces.
  Game may be won with an own move or an opponent move, if the opponent makes a capture
  leaving an only group of pieces; particularly, if one player is reduced by captures (11)
  to a single piece, that is a win for the captured player (a single piece, obviously,
  makes a single group).
  If a move simultaneously creates a win for both players, the player who has made the
  move is the winner.
  The game ends in a draw if 60 moves are made and there still is no winner.
